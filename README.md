Use listener on XMLHttpRequest load event to invoke callback function outside of original XMLHttpRequest request.

Brad Schiff has tutorials and a json file to learn and practice javascript. I'm using his json file to pull the animal data.

I've added the ajax listener to practice getting access to an ajax callback outside the application code. This is helpful when working with third party code or adding analytics code.
